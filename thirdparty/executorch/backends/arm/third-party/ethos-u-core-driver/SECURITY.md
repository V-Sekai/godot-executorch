# Security

If you believe you have identified a security related issue or vulnerability,
then we encourage you to responsibly disclose it to us as soon as possible.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

Arm takes security issues seriously and welcomes feedback from researchers and
the security community in order to improve the security of its products and
services. We operate a coordinated disclosure policy for disclosing
vulnerabilities and other security issues.

Security issues can be complex and one single timescale doesn't fit all
circumstances. We will make best endeavours to inform you when we expect
security notifications and fixes to be available and facilitate coordinated
disclosure when notifications and patches/mitigations are available.

### Report

For all security issues, contact Arm Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT)
by email at [psirt@arm.com](mailto:psirt@arm.com). In the body of the email
include as much information as possible about the issue or vulnerability and any
additional contact details.

### Secure submission using PGP

We support and encourage secure submission of vulnerability reports using PGP,
with the key found at [Report Security Vulnerability](https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/report-security-vulnerabilities).
If you would like replies to be encrypted, please provide your own public key
through a secure mechanism.
