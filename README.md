# Godot ExecuTorch Module

This project is currently in **early development** and is **NOT ready for
production use**.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: NOTHING CURRENTLY WORKS ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This is a **concept/prototype** module intended to integrate ExecuTorch machine learning
inference capabilities into Godot Engine with built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) support.

**Current Status:**

- üî¥ **Nothing is implemented** - this is concept documentation only
- üî¥ **API is completely unstable** and subject to breaking changes
- üî¥ **No working code** - placeholder implementations only
- üî¥ **No testing** - may not even compile
- üî¥ **No official releases** - use at your own risk
- üî¥ **Documentation describes planned features** that don't exist yet

**Planned Features (NOT IMPLEMENTED):**
- ExecuTorchRuntime class for model loading and inference
- Built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- GDScript integration with native performance
- Cross-platform model execution
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking
- Linear regression and other model type support

**TODO - Build System Integration:**
- üîß **Compile ExecuTorch separately** and use its compilation database (`compile_commands.json`) to figure out how to properly build with SCons
- üîß **Extract build flags and dependencies** from ExecuTorch's CMake configuration
- üîß **Port CMake settings to SCons** for proper Godot module integration
- üîß **Handle third-party dependencies** (XNNPACK, etc.) in Godot's build system

**Do not use this in:**

- Production games or applications
- Commercial projects
- Critical systems
- Any project expecting working functionality

**This is for experimentation, planning, and development reference only!**
